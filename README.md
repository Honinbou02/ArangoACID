> ACID-like transactional layer for ArangoDB ‚Äî powered by Foxx Microservices

**ArangoACID** is a generic, reusable, and open-source Foxx microservice that provides atomic transaction support, foreign key integrity simulation, and cascade delete ‚Äî all within your ArangoDB instance.

Perfect for applications that require consistency, safe rollback, and relational data behavior in a multimodel environment.

---

## üÜï What‚Äôs New in Version 1.1

‚úÖ Automatic RESTful endpoints for any collection:

* `POST /arango-acid/api/COLLECTION_NAME`
* `PUT /arango-acid/api/COLLECTION_NAME/_key`
* `DELETE /arango-acid/api/COLLECTION_NAME/_key`

‚úÖ Foreign key validation (FK) on insert and update

‚úÖ Cascade delete support via `onDelete: "cascade"`

‚úÖ Schema validation via embedded Joi rules

‚úÖ Safe transactions with full rollback on failure

‚úÖ Zero external dependencies ‚Äî 100% Foxx-native

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### Using the ArangoDB Web UI:

1. Go to **Services (Foxx)**
2. Click **Upload**
3. Upload the folder or `.zip` file containing `arango-acid`
4. The endpoint will be available at `/arango-acid`

### Using the Foxx CLI:

```bash
foxx install ./arango-acid /arango-acid
```

## üìÅ Project Structure

```
arango-acid/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ executor.js        # Handles transactional operations with rollback
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fkCheck.js         # Simulates foreign key validation
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ validator.js       # Validates schema using Joi

## üîó RESTful Endpoints

Once installed, transactional endpoints become available automatically:

```bash
# Insert into "users" collection
curl -u root:PASSWORD \
  -X POST https://host/_db/_system/arango-acid/api/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"_key": "123", "name": "Tesla"}'

# Update document
curl -u root:PASSWORD \
  -X PUT https://host/_db/_system/arango-acid/api/users/123 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Nikola Tesla"}'

# Delete with cascade (if configured)
curl -u root:PASSWORD \
  -X DELETE https://host/_db/_system/arango-acid/api/users/123
```

All operations use ACID-like transactions with automatic rollback.

---

## üß† Foreign Key Integrity Rules (FKs)

Foreign keys are defined in the special `relations_config` collection:

```json
{
  "_key": "posts",
  "relations": [
    {
      "localField": "author",
      "refCollection": "users",
      "refField": "_key",
      "onDelete": "cascade"
    }
  ]
}
```

This defines:

* The `posts` collection has a field `author`
* It references the `_key` field in the `users` collection
* When a user is deleted, all their posts are automatically removed

You can configure this manually in ArangoDB or via the upcoming `/config/relations` API.

---

## üìÉ Full Payload Example (via `/acid` or internal use)

```json
{
  "schema": {
    "users": {
      "name": "string",
      "email": "string"
    }
  },
  "operations": [
    {
      "collection": "users",
      "action": "insert",
      "data": {
        "_key": "123",
        "name": "Tesla",
        "email": "tesla@arango.dev"
      }
    },
    {
      "collection": "posts",
      "action": "insert",
      "data": {
        "_key": "post1",
        "author": "123",
        "content": "Post 1"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## üîí What Gets Validated?

| Validation Type            | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Joi Schema Validation      | Validates data structure, types, required fields, etc.       |
| Foreign Key (FK) Integrity | Validates referenced documents exist before insert/update    |
| Cascade Delete             | Automatically deletes child documents if `onDelete: cascade` |
| ACID-like Transactions     | Rolls back all operations if any one of them fails           |

---

## üß† Why Use ArangoACID?

* ArangoDB lacks native relational integrity
* Schema validation requires custom code
* REST operations don‚Äôt support rollback out of the box

ArangoACID solves all of this in a **centralized, reusable, and robust** way.
